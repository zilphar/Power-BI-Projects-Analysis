# Renewable-Energy-Analysis
**<ins> Introduction<ins/>**

This is an analysis carried out to determine the trend of the % share of electricity that comes from renewablee energy in Kenya, the installed cpcity of Geothermal, Wind, and Solr overtime, and the stand of installed capacity as of 2023 for Geothermal, wind, solar, and hydro. 
For the analysis I used data from the Owid energy: https://ourworldindata.org/renewable-energy  
and Referenced data from the Kenya Vision 2030. 

**<ins>Questions to Answer <ins/>**

1. What is th general trend of % share of electricity generated from renewable sources throughout the years to 2023?
2. What is the trend on installed capacity of Geothermal, Solar, and Wind energy plants througout the years?
3. How does the current Geotherml installed capacity vary with the Kenya vision 2030 aim on geothermal installed capacity? 

**<ins> Insights Derived <ins/>**
1. The % share of electricity from renewable energy has been increasing over the years with currently (2023) being at 94.02%, missing the 100% mark by 5.98%. The current share is a 2.20% increase from the previous share of 91.99%.
2. The installed capacity of Geothermal, Wind, and Solar has been increasing over the years with Geothermal having the most instlled capacity as of 2023 at 891.80 MW, a 6.04% decrease from the installed capacity preveiously (949.10 MW).

The Hydro generation has the second largest installed capcity of 826.23 MW as of 2023. 
3. According to the Kenya Vision 2030, the country aims at 5,530MW of instlled geothermal capcity making it the main source of renewable energy in the country covering 51% of total installed capacity of renewables. Currently the Geothermal intalled capacity is at 891.80 MW which is 6.2 times lower that the aimed capacity in the next 6 years.
